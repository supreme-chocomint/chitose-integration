# Site Integration for chi歳

A script that adds [chi歳](https://supreme-chocomint.github.io/chitose/) links to voice actor pages on MAL, AniList, ANN, and AP. These links make looking up a voice actor's most popular characters or seasonal roles a lot faster.

See [the main web app repo](https://github.com/supreme-chocomint/chitose) for more information.

## Requirements
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (probably works with other userscript managers too)
- Modern Firefox, Chrome, or variants

## Install
- Click [here](https://github.com/supreme-chocomint/chitose-integration/raw/master/integration.user.js) once you have Tampermonkey installed, and click "install"
- If the script is not automatically detected for some reason: copy the code from [here](https://github.com/supreme-chocomint/chitose-integration/blob/master/integration.user.js), open the Tampermonkey dashboard, click the "+" button in the top right tabs, delete the default new code, paste the copied code, and save

## Usage
- On AniList and AP, the links are underneath the bios/descriptions
- On MAL, the link is in the left column underneath the profile picture
- On ANN, the link is underneath the name at the top of the page
