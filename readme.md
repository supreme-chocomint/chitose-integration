# Site Integration for Chitose

A script that adds [Chitose](https://themightyhotel.bitbucket.io/chi) links to voice actor pages on MAL, AniList, ANN, and AP. It makes looking up a voice actor's most popular characters or seasonal roles a lot faster.

For each voice actor, there are two links (full profile and search/season) avaliable on AniList, and one for all the other sites (search/season).

## Requirements
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (probably works with other userscript managers too)
- Modern Firefox, Chrome, or variants

## Install
- Click [here](https://bitbucket.org/themightyhotel/chi-integration/raw/master/integration.user.js) once you have Tampermonkey installed, and click "install"
- If the script is not automatically detected: copy the code, open Tampermonkey, click the "+" button in the top right tabs, delete the default new code, paste the copied code, and save

## Usage
- On AniList and AP, the links are underneath the bios/descriptions
- On MAL, the link is in the left column underneath the profile picture
- On ANN, the link is underneath the name at the top of the page
